This is the place where you place all your html files.
In order to access them you have to import "from flask import g,request,json,render_template,render_template_string" in manager.py file

for ex: "render_template('reset_password_success.html')"
from Models.user import User
from Models.<filename in Models folder> import <class name in that file >
